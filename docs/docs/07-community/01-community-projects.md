### Raycast Extension

_By [@luolei](https://github.com/foru17)._

### Alfred Workflow (inline search)

_By [@Kyzcreig](https://github.com/Kyzcreig)_

An Alfred workflow for inline bookmark search — type `kk <query>` and see live results (title, tags, URL) directly in Alfred, using Karakeep's full query language (`is:fav`, `#tag`, `list:`, `age:`). Enter opens the original URL; Cmd-Enter opens the bookmark in Karakeep. Responses are cached per-query so typing stays lag-free.

Get it [here](https://github.com/Kyzcreig/alfred-karakeep).

### KaraClone

_By [@gowinder](https://github.com/gowinder)._

A from-scratch reimplementation of the Karakeep server API that runs entirely on the **Cloudflare Workers free tier** (D1, R2, Queues, Workers AI, Cron). It's aimed at people who want to self-host their bookmarks but don't have a VPS or home server: no machine to patch, no container to run, no backups to script.

The official clients (mobile app and browser extension) log in with a server URL + API key, unmodified. Bookmarks are persisted immediately on save; title extraction, AI tagging, and summaries run asynchronously in a background queue.

:::note
This is a server-side implementation that targets the internal tRPC API used by the official clients, which — unlike the public REST API — carries no compatibility guarantees. It tracks specific client versions (currently Mobile 1.11.0 / Extension 1.2.11); clients newer than that may or may not work against it.
